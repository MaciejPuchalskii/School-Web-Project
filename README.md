# School-Web-Project
Project using HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/SQL


This website is built using several web technologies including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL. It is fully responsive, which means it looks and works well on various devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones.

To create animations on the website, I used both JavaScript and jQuery. These tools are very useful in creating interactive and attractive elements on a website. Additionally, I utilized AJAX technology to load some data on the website without having to reload the entire page. This significantly improves the loading speed and interactivity of the website.

To ensure user security, I used PHP for data validation as well as handling login and registration. PHP is a very popular web programming language and is used for many purposes such as session management, sending and receiving data from the database, form handling, and many others.
